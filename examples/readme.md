# Adding an Example

To add an example simply create a new file in `examples/example` where the filename
is the title of the example (with dashes in place of spaces and .php at the end). The
file should contain a short description at the top followed by the code to create
and output the form. Please keep your example as simple as is required to show the
functionality required.

The other example scripts will handle displaying it. See `examples/example/multiple-submit-buttons.php`
for a simple example.
